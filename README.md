# LUTE's In C App (Web Edition)

This is a Web Audio-based reimplementation of the Loyola University Technology
Ensemble's Max application for performing Terry Riley's *'In C'*. It is
currently in active development and should be considered alpha-quality. After
completion, this app should support most modern browsers and have a responsive
design supporting mobile, tablets, and laptops.

## Development

the source directory for any changes and dynamically rebuild the JS bundle. Requires
